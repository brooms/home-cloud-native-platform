# Architecture

Archtecture is designed to offer a self contained, portable eco-system which can be readily deployed on different host systems. 

Portability means that once deployed the eco-system does not require external access or can be moved to a different environment and integrated with minimal changes (single entry point).

Allows compute nodes to be added or removed.

Offers some level of resilience.
